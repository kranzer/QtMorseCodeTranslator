# QtMorseCodeTranslator
My test task for milosolutions

To use this app you need to create a configuration file, or use the one I provide(config.txt, the same name should be even if you create your own config).
The format of config file is:
symbol of natural language, three spaces, morse equivalent (all of them without quotes).
E.g.:
a   .-

Thank you!
